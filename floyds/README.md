## 🚀 Floyd-Warshall Algorithm in Python 

This repository implements the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm using both recursive and iterative approaches. The project includes performance tests and unit tests to compare the efficiency of both implementations.

## 📌 What is this repository for? 

* Version: 1.0
* Implements the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm for finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
* Includes performance benchmarking and unit tests.

## 🛠️ How do I get set up?

* Install Dependencies

        pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 Running the Scripts

1️⃣ Run the Floyd-Warshall Implementations from a python IDE. (Both performance_test & unittest needs to be run from terminal.)

* Recursive Version

        python recursion/recursive_floyd.py

* Iterative Version

      python iterative/iterative_floyd.py

2️⃣ Run Performance Test

* To compare the execution times of both implementations:

        python tests/performance_test.py

3️⃣ Run Unit Tests

* To verify that both implementations work correctly:

        python tests/unittests.py
